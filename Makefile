	poetry install
	poetry build
	poetry run pip install --upgrade -t package dist/*.whl
	cd package; zip -r ../hcw-api.zip . -x "*.pyc"

publish: # Publish the project artefact @Pipeline
	# TODO: Implement the artefact publishing step

deploy: # Deploy the project artefact to the target environment @Pipeline
	# TODO: Implement the artefact deployment step

clean:: # Clean-up project resources (main) @Operations
	# TODO: Implement project resources clean-up step
